# See Ghana Tours
 I built this prototype website for the Ghana Tourism Development(GTDC) company during my national service. I built it with html5 & Sass. I also integrated a virtual tourism application into the website in order to present a proposal to the management of the Ghana Tourism development company to create a virtual tour for all tourist sites that they manage.
